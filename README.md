# BayesBoost
Bayesian Optimization using xgboost and sklearn API

Simple test scripts for optimal hyperparameter of xgboost using bayesian optimization.

Example 1. is based on the otto dataset from Kaggle, this remains in memory.
Example 2. is based on Avazu click prediction dataset from Kaggle and requires the 'external' memory version of xgboost.

This is a work in progress and may fail / have bugs.
